#Imaging RPi's with MATE 
Mate is prefered to Raspbian as ros is pre-built. As of Jan 2020 it is not available on the RPi 4.
Install from [here](https://ubuntu-mate.org/raspberry-pi/) and install ros [like usual](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)

# Imaging RPi's with buster
Installing packages requires building them, which takes a long time. When possible use Ubuntu/Mate
To install ROS melodic on Rasbian buster [this](https://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Kinetic%20on%20the%20Raspberry%20Pi) link and replace kinetic with melodic and jessie with buster in all commands
